## üí° Teaching Tips

### **For Difficult Sections (3 & 4):**

**Section 3 Tips:**
1. ‚úÖ **Before running code:** Walk through the 6 steps on whiteboard
2. ‚úÖ **Live demo:** Open browser, show the FDIC website, view source to see `<table>` tags
3. ‚úÖ **Emphasize:** The list vs DataFrame distinction (most common error!)
4. ‚úÖ **Show output:** Point out how the improved code shows more info (‚úÖ symbols, size, etc.)

**Section 4 Tips:**
1. ‚úÖ **Visual first:** Draw the flow diagram on board
2. ‚úÖ **Real example:** Open cafef.vn/thi-truong-chung-khoan.rss in browser
3. ‚úÖ **Step-by-step:** Don't rush - this is complex!
4. ‚úÖ **Relate to students:** "Like getting news updates on your phone"

### **Common Student Questions:**

**Q1: "Why does `pd.read_html()` return a list?"**
**A:** Because a webpage can have MANY tables! Pandas finds all of them. You choose which one you need.

**Q2: "Why do we need BeautifulSoup for XML but not for HTML tables?"**
**A:** Pandas has built-in `read_html()` for tables. But for RSS (special XML), we need to extract custom tags like `<item>`, `<title>` that Pandas doesn't understand.

**Q3: "Do we always need to read data multiple times?"**
**A:** NO! (Point to improved code) - Read once, reuse the variable. Faster and cleaner!

**Q4: "What if the website structure changes?"**
**A:** Good question! Web scraping can break if site changes. That's why we save to CSV - stable local copy.
