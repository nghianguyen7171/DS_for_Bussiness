## Grading Philosophy

### Homework & Assignments
- **Emphasis on learning:** Homework is designed to reinforce concepts and provide practice
- **Iteration encouraged:** You can revise and resubmit some assignments for improved scores (when specified)
- **Late penalty:** 1 point deduction per day late

### Knowledge Checks
- **Application-focused:** Tests your ability to apply concepts, not just memorize
- **Open-book/notes (when specified):** Some assessments allow reference materials
- **Time-limited:** Designed to assess proficiency within realistic constraints

### Final Exam
- **Comprehensive assessment:** Validates mastery of all learning outcomes
- **Standardized format:** Ensures fairness and consistency across all students
- **Closed book:** Tests retention and understanding without external aids

---

## Academic Integrity

All assessments are subject to university academic integrity policies:

- **Collaboration:** Encouraged for learning, but all submitted work must be your own
- **Code reuse:** You may reference course materials and textbooks, but must cite sources
- **Plagiarism:** Copying code or text without attribution is prohibited
- **Exam conduct:** Individual work only; no communication with other students during exams

**Violations will result in:**
- Zero score on the assignment/exam
- Potential course failure
- Referral to university disciplinary committee

---

## Grade Inquiries

If you have questions about a grade:

1. **Review the rubric** and feedback provided
2. **Wait 24 hours** before contacting the instructor (allow time for reflection)
3. **Submit a written request** explaining your specific concern
4. **Meet with the instructor** during office hours if needed
5. **Deadline:** Grade inquiries must be submitted within **one week** of receiving the grade

## Tips for Success

✅ **Attend all classes** and participate actively

✅ **Complete homework on time** to reinforce learning

✅ **Practice coding regularly** - data science is a skill developed through repetition

✅ **Use office hours** when you need help or clarification

✅ **Form study groups** to discuss concepts and solve problems together

✅ **Start assignments early** to avoid last-minute stress

✅ **Review feedback** on graded work to understand mistakes and improve
