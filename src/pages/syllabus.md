## Course Description

This course provides an introductory foundation in data science thinking and techniques for students in economics, finance, and business administration. It equips learners to leverage and analyze data for decision-making in business environments, covering the complete lifecycle of a data science project from data collection and cleaning to visualization, modeling, and reporting. The course emphasizes hands-on learning with real-world datasets through exercises and small projects.

---

## Prerequisites

Students should have completed:
- Mathematics for Economists
- Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics (or Statistics in Economics and Business)

---

## Course Objectives

**G1:** Understand the roles and applications of data science in economics, finance, and marketing, and describe the basic steps in the lifecycle of a data science project.

**G2:** Use Python programming to process tabular data, including writing statements with basic control structures and using NumPy and Pandas.

**G3:** Understand processes for collecting, cleaning, and wrangling data from common sources, using transformations, combinations, and aggregations for analysis.

**G4:** Apply visualization tools and reporting to build appropriate data visualizations aligned with analytical goals, and present and interpret results in reports using Markdown, PDF, or presentation formats.

**G5:** Apply basic machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, etc., to solve simple predictive tasks in business, and evaluate models with quantitative metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤.
