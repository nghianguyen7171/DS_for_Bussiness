description: |
  This course provides an introductory foundation in data science thinking and techniques for students in economics, finance, and business administration. It equips learners to leverage and analyze data for decision-making in business environments, covering the complete lifecycle of a data science project from data collection and cleaning to visualization, modeling, and reporting. The course emphasizes hands-on learning with real-world datasets through exercises and small projects.
