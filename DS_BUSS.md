# 3. COURSE DESCRIPTION

- Provides an introductory foundation in data science thinking and techniques for students in economics, finance, and business administration.
- Objective: equip learners to leverage and analyze data for decision-making in business environments.
    - Content: the complete lifecycle of a data science project, including:
    - Introduction to data science and applications in economics and business;
    - Basic programming with Python;
    - Data collection and ingestion from multiple sources; data cleaning and wrangling;
    - Data visualization for exploring relationships and trends;
    - Data modeling with basic statistical and machine learning techniques;
    - Communicating analysis results in structured reports.

The course is designed to be hands-on, encouraging students to develop skills with real-world data through exercises and small projects. The course encourages, but does not require, prior background in programming or probability and statistics.
