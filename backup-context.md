```

### Build Pipeline
```
Source Files (src/) 
    ↓
[build.js - Node.js Script]
    ↓
1. Load YAML data
2. Register Handlebars partials
3. Compile SCSS → CSS
4. Render templates → HTML
5. Convert Markdown → HTML pages

6. **Copy Assets:** 
   - `src/assets/` → `docs/assets/`
   - `img/` (instructor photos) → `docs/assets/images/`
7. **Copy Quizzes:** `Quiz/` → `docs/quiz/`
8. **Render Index:** `src/index.hbs` + data → `docs/index.html`
9. **Render Pages:** `src/pages/*.md` → `docs/*.html` (with wrapper template)

### Handlebars Helpers
```javascript
Handlebars.registerHelper('eq', (a, b) => a === b);
Handlebars.registerHelper('gt', (a, b) => a > b);
Handlebars.registerHelper('lt', (a, b) => a < b);

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### SCSS Deprecation Warnings
**Issue:** Sass shows deprecation warnings for `@import`, `lighten()`, `darken()`  
**Impact:** None - still works, warnings only  
**Solution (future):** Migrate to `@use` and `color.scale()` functions

### Build Warnings
**Issue:** "8 repetitive deprecation warnings omitted"  
**Impact:** Cosmetic only, build succeeds  
**Solution:** Safe to ignore or update SCSS syntax

### Node Modules Size
**Issue:** 264 packages, 6 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 4 high)  
**Impact:** Development only, not in production  
**Solution:** Run `npm audit fix` if needed (optional)

## 🔍 Important File Paths

### Images:
- Source: `/Users/nguyennghia/PROJECT/DS_BUSSINESS/img/*.jpg|jpeg`
- Build copies to: `docs/assets/images/`
- Referenced in YAML as: `assets/images/filename.jpg`

### Quizzes:
- Source: `Quiz/Lec##_quiz/`
- Build copies to: `docs/quiz/Lec##_quiz/`
- Referenced in quizzes.yml as: `quiz/Lec##_quiz/index.html`

### Data Flow:
```
src/data/*.yml → loaded by build.js → passed to templates → rendered HTML
src/pages/*.md → converted to HTML → wrapped in template → output as *.html
```

## 🚨 Critical Notes for Future Sessions

### Important Context:
1. **DO NOT modify /docs directly** - always edit src/ and rebuild
2. **YAML syntax is strict** - indentation matters
3. **Image paths** - must match exactly (case-sensitive)
4. **Quiz links** - relative to docs/ root
5. **Build must run** before deploying
6. **Deploy script** handles git operations
7. **GitHub Pages** serves from /docs on main branch

### Files to Never Edit Directly:
- `docs/**/*` (generated by build)
- `package-lock.json` (managed by npm)

### Files to Edit:
- `src/data/*.yml` (content updates)
- `src/pages/*.md` (page content)
- `src/styles/*.scss` (styling)
- `src/scripts/main.js` (functionality)
- `src/**/*.hbs` (templates)

### When Things Break:
```bash
# Clean rebuild
rm -rf docs node_modules
npm install
npm run build

# Check build output
ls -la docs/
cat docs/index.html | head -20

# Verify git status
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

## 📝 Change Log

### October 8, 2025 - Instructor Website Links Added

**Change:** Added personal website links to instructor profiles

**Files Modified:**
1. `src/data/instructors.yml` - Added `website` field for each instructor
2. `src/partials/sections/instructors.hbs` - Updated template to make names clickable
3. `src/styles/_components.scss` - Added `.instructor-name-link` styling

**Implementation Details:**
- Each instructor name now links to their personal website
- Links open in new tab (`target="_blank"`)
- Added security attributes (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`)
- Hover effect: name changes to primary color (#2563eb)
- Smooth transition animation on hover

**Instructor Website URLs:**
- Dr. Nguyen Trong Nghia: https://nghianguyen7171.github.io/
- MSc. Nguyen Thi Minh Trang: https://fda.neu.edu.vn/fda-members/ths-nguyen-thi-minh-trang/
- MSc. Dam Tien Thanh: https://fda.neu.edu.vn/fda-members/ths-dam-tien-thanh/

**CSS Styling:**
```scss
.instructor-name-link {
  color: var(--text-primary);
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: color 150ms ease-in-out;
  
  &:hover {
    color: $color-primary;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
```

**Template Logic:**
```handlebars
{{#if website}}
  <h3><a href="{{website}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="instructor-name-link">{{name}}</a></h3>
{{else}}
  <h3>{{name}}</h3>
{{/if}}
```

**Build Status:** ✅ Rebuilt successfully  
**Deployment Status:** ✅ Committed (5a6942a) and pushed to GitHub  
**Live Status:** Will be live after GitHub Pages rebuilds (~1-2 minutes)

### October 8, 2025 - Fixed openpyxl Version Issue in Notebook

**Issue:** ImportError when reading Excel files in Jupyter notebook
- Error: `Pandas requires version '3.1.0' or newer of 'openpyxl' (version '3.0.10' currently installed)`
- Location: `notebook/T6_nhập_và_lưu_trữ_dữ_liệu_Python.ipynb` - Cell 20 (Section 5.1)

**Root Cause:**
- Pandas version compatibility issue with openpyxl
- Had openpyxl 3.0.10, but pandas requires 3.1.0+

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade openpyxl
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Upgraded openpyxl from 3.0.10 → 3.1.5
- ✅ Excel file reading now works correctly
- ✅ Dependencies: et-xmlfile 2.0.0 also installed

**Affected Code:**
```python
import pandas as pd
xlsx = pd.ExcelFile("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tranhungemail/DSImageCourse/main/ex6.xlsx")
df_excel_sheet2 = xlsx.parse(sheet_name="Sheet2")
df_excel_sheet1 = xlsx.parse(sheet_name="Sheet1")
```

**Prevention:**
- Always check pandas and openpyxl compatibility
- Keep dependencies updated in requirements.txt
- Document version requirements clearly

---

### October 8, 2025 - Major Notebook Improvements for Teaching

**Change:** Comprehensive improvements to `notebook/T6_nhập_và_lưu_trữ_dữ_liệu_Python.ipynb` to make it more student-friendly and easier to understand during lectures.

**Problem Identified:**
- Students found Section 3 (Web scraping) and Section 4 (XML/RSS) difficult to understand
- Code was repetitive (same data read multiple times)
- Lack of visual structure and step-by-step breakdowns
- Missing learning objectives and summaries

**Improvements Made:**

**1. Added Visual Structure:**
- 📍 Added learning roadmap at beginning showing all 7 sections with difficulty levels
- 💡 Added objective boxes at start of each major section
- 🎯 Clear "what you will learn" statements
- ⚠️ Warning boxes for common pitfalls
- ✅ Summary cards at end of each section

**2. Improved Section 3 (Web Scraping):**
- Added step-by-step breakdown (6 steps) before code
- Enhanced code comments with step numbers (BƯỚC 1, 2, 3...)
- **Removed code repetition** - sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 now reuse `failures` variable
- Added better output messages with emojis for clarity
- Added explanatory text for why each step is needed

**Solution Applied:**

**Questions Enhanced (7 questions):**

1. **Question 1 (CSV Basic):**
   - Added ex1.csv content visualization
   - Shows: Header line + 3 data rows
   - Format: Diem 1, Diem 2, Diem 3, Diem 4, Nhan xet

2. **Question 2 (CSV Header):**
   - Added ex2.csv content (no header)
   - Shows: 4 data rows without header
   - Emphasizes: "KHÔNG CÓ HEADER"

3. **Question 3 (CSV Names):**
   - Added ex2.csv content
   - Shows same file as Q2
   - Context for names parameter

4. **Question 4 (CSV Index):**
   - Added ex2.csv content
   - Shows file structure for index_col understanding

5. **Question 5 (CSV Separator):**
   - Added ex3.txt content
   - Shows space-separated data
   - Visualizes: A B C D format

6. **Question 6 (CSV Skip Rows):**
   - Added ex4.csv structure with junk rows
   - Shows: Rows 0,2,3 are garbage text
   - Clear visualization of what gets skipped

7. **Question 7 (Missing Data):**
   - Added ex5.csv description
   - Shows: File with missing values marked
   - Example: Chi thiếu Diem_Anh

**Bonus Enhancements:**
8. **Question 8 (JSON):** Added student.json structure
9. **Question 9 (JSON Missing):** Added missing data pattern
10. **Question 17-18 (Excel):** Added data.xlsx multi-sheet structure

**Visualization Format:**
```javascript
"code": "# File ex1.csv có nội dung:\n# Diem 1,Diem 2,Diem 3,Diem 4,Nhan xet\n# 1,2,3,4,Hoc luc yeu\n# 5,6,7,8,Hoc luc trung binh kha\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('ex1.csv')\nprint(df.head(2))"
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Quiz/Lec04_quiz/app.js` (7 core questions + 3 bonus)

- **After:** "Oh! The file has header 'Diem 1, Diem 2...', so read_csv() will use that as column names!" 😊

**Build Status:** ✅ Rebuilt successfully  
**Deployment Status:** ✅ Committed (e75c6c5) and pushed to GitHub  
**Live Quiz:** https://nghianguyen7171.github.io/DS_for_Bussiness/quiz/Lec04_quiz/index.html
