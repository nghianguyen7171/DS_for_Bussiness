### Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "build": "node build.js",
  "dev": "node build.js && node server.js",
  "clean": "rm -rf docs"
}
```

### Build Process (build.js)
1. **Clean:** Remove old `docs/` directory
2. **Load Data:** Read all YAML files from `src/data/`

6. **Copy Assets:** 
   - `src/assets/` → `docs/assets/`
   - `img/` (instructor photos) → `docs/assets/images/`
7. **Copy Quizzes:** `Quiz/` → `docs/quiz/`
8. **Render Index:** `src/index.hbs` + data → `docs/index.html`
9. **Render Pages:** `src/pages/*.md` → `docs/*.html` (with wrapper template)

### Handlebars Helpers
```javascript
Handlebars.registerHelper('eq', (a, b) => a === b);
Handlebars.registerHelper('gt', (a, b) => a > b);
Handlebars.registerHelper('lt', (a, b) => a < b);

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### SCSS Deprecation Warnings
**Issue:** Sass shows deprecation warnings for `@import`, `lighten()`, `darken()`  
**Impact:** None - still works, warnings only  
**Solution (future):** Migrate to `@use` and `color.scale()` functions

### Build Warnings
**Issue:** "8 repetitive deprecation warnings omitted"  
**Impact:** Cosmetic only, build succeeds  
**Solution:** Safe to ignore or update SCSS syntax

### Node Modules Size
**Issue:** 264 packages, 6 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 4 high)  
**Impact:** Development only, not in production  
**Solution:** Run `npm audit fix` if needed (optional)

## 🔍 Important File Paths

### Images:
- Source: `/Users/nguyennghia/PROJECT/DS_BUSSINESS/img/*.jpg|jpeg`
- Build copies to: `docs/assets/images/`
- Referenced in YAML as: `assets/images/filename.jpg`

### Quizzes:
- Source: `Quiz/Lec##_quiz/`
- Build copies to: `docs/quiz/Lec##_quiz/`
- Referenced in quizzes.yml as: `quiz/Lec##_quiz/index.html`

### Data Flow:
```
src/data/*.yml → loaded by build.js → passed to templates → rendered HTML
src/pages/*.md → converted to HTML → wrapped in template → output as *.html
```

## 🚨 Critical Notes for Future Sessions

### Important Context:
1. **DO NOT modify /docs directly** - always edit src/ and rebuild
2. **YAML syntax is strict** - indentation matters
3. **Image paths** - must match exactly (case-sensitive)
4. **Quiz links** - relative to docs/ root
5. **Build must run** before deploying
6. **Deploy script** handles git operations
7. **GitHub Pages** serves from /docs on main branch

### Files to Never Edit Directly:
- `docs/**/*` (generated by build)
- `package-lock.json` (managed by npm)

### Files to Edit:
- `src/data/*.yml` (content updates)
- `src/pages/*.md` (page content)
- `src/styles/*.scss` (styling)
- `src/scripts/main.js` (functionality)
- `src/**/*.hbs` (templates)

### When Things Break:
```bash
# Clean rebuild
rm -rf docs node_modules
npm install
npm run build

# Check build output
ls -la docs/
cat docs/index.html | head -20

# Verify git status
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

## 📝 Change Log

### October 18, 2025 - Test Library Creation: 67 Questions for Lec1-Lec5

**Change:** Created comprehensive test library with 67 multiple-choice questions covering Lectures 1-5 content only. All Lec6 topics (MultiIndex, merge, concat, reshape operations) have been removed.

**User Request:**
1. "Review all quiz in folder @Quiz, all notebook in @notebook. I want to create 1 test library of about 60 questions in Vietnamese. All questions are multiple choice - 4 options. Content from Lec1 to Lec6, including theory and code."
2. "Add 40 more questions. The questions need to be structured: ask a question, choose the code that best fits the question from among 4 possible answers."
3. "Eliminate questions related to Lec7 visualization"
4. "Remove all content of lec6, only keep content from lec1 to 5 but remain the file name"

**Solution Implemented:**

**1. Comprehensive Content Review:**
- ✅ Reviewed all quiz files (Lec02, Lec03, Lec04, Lec05)
- ✅ Analyzed notebooks (Lec1-Lec5) to extract key concepts
- ✅ Identified unique topics not covered in existing quizzes

  - NumPy operations: arange, sum, max, reshape (4 questions)
  - DataFrame operations: creation, selection, reading CSV (3 questions)
  - Data cleaning: dropna, fillna, drop_duplicates (3 questions)
  - Normalization: MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler (2 questions)
  - String processing: str methods (2 questions)
  - Encoding: LabelEncoder, One-Hot Encoding (2 questions)
  - General operations: apply, groupby, filter (3 questions)

### October 8, 2025 - Quiz Questions Enhanced with File Visualizations

**Change:** Added file content visualizations to quiz questions that reference external files.

**Critical Problem Identified:**
- 7 quiz questions referenced files (ex1.csv, ex2.csv, etc.) without showing their content
- Students couldn't answer these questions without knowing the file structure
- Questions were impossible to solve independently
- Example: "What is output of `pd.read_csv('ex1.csv')`?" without showing ex1.csv content

**Solution Applied:**

**Questions Enhanced (7 questions):**

1. **Question 1 (CSV Basic):**
   - Added ex1.csv content visualization
   - Shows: Header line + 3 data rows
   - Format: Diem 1, Diem 2, Diem 3, Diem 4, Nhan xet

2. **Question 2 (CSV Header):**
   - Added ex2.csv content (no header)
   - Shows: 4 data rows without header
   - Emphasizes: "KHÔNG CÓ HEADER"

3. **Question 3 (CSV Names):**
   - Added ex2.csv content
   - Shows same file as Q2
   - Context for names parameter

4. **Question 4 (CSV Index):**
   - Added ex2.csv content
   - Shows file structure for index_col understanding

5. **Question 5 (CSV Separator):**
   - Added ex3.txt content
   - Shows space-separated data
   - Visualizes: A B C D format

6. **Question 6 (CSV Skip Rows):**
   - Added ex4.csv structure with junk rows
   - Shows: Rows 0,2,3 are garbage text
   - Clear visualization of what gets skipped

7. **Question 7 (Missing Data):**
   - Added ex5.csv description
   - Shows: File with missing values marked
   - Example: Chi thiếu Diem_Anh

**Bonus Enhancements:**
8. **Question 8 (JSON):** Added student.json structure
9. **Question 9 (JSON Missing):** Added missing data pattern
10. **Question 17-18 (Excel):** Added data.xlsx multi-sheet structure

**Visualization Format:**
```javascript
"code": "# File ex1.csv có nội dung:\n# Diem 1,Diem 2,Diem 3,Diem 4,Nhan xet\n# 1,2,3,4,Hoc luc yeu\n# 5,6,7,8,Hoc luc trung binh kha\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('ex1.csv')\nprint(df.head(2))"
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Quiz/Lec04_quiz/app.js` (7 core questions + 3 bonus)
- `docs/quiz/Lec04_quiz/app.js` (rebuilt)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Quiz is now completely self-contained
- ✅ Students can solve ALL questions independently
- ✅ Better pedagogical value (shows file structure concepts)
- ✅ Professional quiz quality
- ✅ No confusion about file formats
- ✅ Visual learning enhanced

**Student Experience:**
- **Before:** "I don't know what's in ex1.csv, how can I answer this?" 😕
- **After:** "Oh! The file has header 'Diem 1, Diem 2...', so read_csv() will use that as column names!" 😊

**Build Status:** ✅ Rebuilt successfully  
**Deployment Status:** ✅ Committed (e75c6c5) and pushed to GitHub  
**Live Quiz:** https://nghianguyen7171.github.io/DS_for_Bussiness/quiz/Lec04_quiz/index.html
